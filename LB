 L4 TCP load balancer. In this case, a client makes a TCP connection to the load balancer.
 The load balancer terminates the connection (i.e. responds directly to the SYN), selects a backend, 
 and makes a new TCP connection to the backend (i.e. sends a new SYN). The details of the diagram 
 arenâ€™t important and will be discussed in detail in the section below dedicated to L4 load balancing.

The key takeaway of this section is that an L4 load balancer typically operates only at the level of 
the L4 TCP/UDP connection/session. Thus the load balancer roughly shuffles bytes back and forth, 
and makes sure that bytes from the same session wind up at the same backend. The L4 load balancer 
is unaware of any application details of the bytes that it is shuffling. The bytes could be HTTP, Redis, 
MongoDB, or any other application protocol.
